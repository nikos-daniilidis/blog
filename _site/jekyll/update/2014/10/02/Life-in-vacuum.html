  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The original intention of this post was to talk about using real analysis to understand a concept in set theory which bugged me. I consequently had to heavily edit the post, after friends informed me that I had gotten the logic aspect all wrong. So the post is really a cautionary tale about trying not to be the proverbial arrogant physicist <a href="http://molbiohut.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/arrogance-of-physicists-towards-biology/">1</a>,<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/02/16/why-do-physicists-think-they-a/">2</a>,<a href="http://galileospendulum.org/2011/02/17/the-arrogance-of-physicists/">3</a>,<a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2556#comic">4</a>, and about so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">“vacuous truths”</a>. In fact, it could be titled “How I learned to stop worrying and love the empty set”.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2014-10-02-Life-in-vacuum/smbphysicist2.png" alt="blabbing physicist" /></p>

<p>The discussion which inspired me to start on this topic had to do with the correct implementation (in the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">scala</a> programming language) of a toolbox which allows the user to define mathematical sets, as well as a number of functions on those sets, for example union, intersection, difference, etc. In specific, I was in disagreement with two other programmers on what would be acceptable behavior for a function which checks if a condition <script type="math/tex"> p(x)</script> is true for all elements <script type="math/tex"> x</script> in a set, <script type="math/tex"> S</script>. Let’s call this function forall. The sets for which we were implementing the function can contain integers only, so in scala syntax the definition of forall would be</p>

<pre><code>	forall(S: Set, p: Int =&gt; Booolean): Boolean
</code></pre>

<p>This is the formal way to define a function which takes two arguments: <code>S</code>: a set (whatever this data type may be), and <code>p</code>: a function which maps integer values to boolean values. The <code>forall</code> function returns a boolean value, true if <script type="math/tex"> p(x)</script> holds for all <script type="math/tex"> x</script> in <script type="math/tex"> S</script>, and false otherwise. For example if <script type="math/tex"> S = \left[1,2,3\right]</script>, and <script type="math/tex"> p(x) = (x\;\; is\;\; even)</script>, then <code>forall(S,p)</code> evaluates to false, while if <script type="math/tex"> p(x) = (x\;\; is\;\; positive)</script> then <code>forall(S,p)</code> evaluates to true. To smooth the notation from now on, I will use <script type="math/tex"> f\left(S,p\right)</script> to denote the <code>forall(S,p)</code> function. I will also replace the logical value of true by 1, and logical false by 0.</p>

<p>Now the disagreement was about the behavior of <script type="math/tex"> f\left(S,p\right)</script> under extreme conditions: What should be the output if <script type="math/tex"> S</script> is the empty set, and the function <script type="math/tex"> p(x)</script> evaluates to 0 (false) for all <script type="math/tex"> x</script>? The answer of the other programmers was along the lines of: I am trying to check if for all <script type="math/tex"> x</script> in <script type="math/tex"> S</script>, <script type="math/tex"> p(x)</script> is 1 (i.e. true). To show this, I have to demonstrate that I cannot find any element in <script type="math/tex"> S</script> for which <script type="math/tex"> p(x)</script> is 0.</p>

<p>For example, the statement (x is not equal to x) is true for all elements of the empty set, because there is no element of the empty set for which the statement (x is not equal to x) is false. This is usually called a “vacuous truth”. Therefore, for an empty set the <script type="math/tex"> f\left(S,p\right)</script> function should always evaluate to 1.</p>

<p>My misunderstanding was that I should equally well be able  to declare that I need to demonstrate I cannot find any element in <script type="math/tex"> S</script> for which <script type="math/tex"> p(x)</script> is 1, and thus conclude that the natural choice would be for <script type="math/tex"> f\left(S,p\right)</script> to always be 0 on an empty set. So it seemed to me like this reasoning did not lead to any well-defined conclusion.</p>

<p>What I proposed was an alternative reasoning by generalizing to continuity on sets of real numbers: Consider the set <script type="math/tex"> s_{\epsilon} = \left(0,\epsilon\right)</script> with <script type="math/tex"> \epsilon \neq 0</script>, which is just an open-ended interval on the real line. Then, I can consider a generalization of the <script type="math/tex"> f\left(S,p\right)</script> function which accepts sets containing real numbers as inputs. With my choice of interval <script type="math/tex"> s_{\epsilon}</script>, the limit <script type="math/tex"> \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0}s_{\epsilon} = \emptyset</script> (the empty set). At the same time, for any <script type="math/tex"> s_{\epsilon} \neq 0</script>, it is true that <script type="math/tex"> f\left(s_{\epsilon},0\right) = 0</script>, and consequently <script type="math/tex"> \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0} f\left(s_{\epsilon},0\right) = 0</script>. Thus, if I want <script type="math/tex"> f\left(S,p\right)</script> to be “continuous” in the sense that <script type="math/tex"> \lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0} f\left(s_{\epsilon},0\right) = f\left(\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow0}s_{\epsilon},0\right)</script>, then I must define <script type="math/tex"> f\left(\emptyset,0\right) \equiv 0</script>. Likewise, I must define <script type="math/tex"> f\left(\emptyset,1\right) \equiv 1</script>.</p>

<p>Apparently, this reasoning is not satisfactory. Aesthetically appealing as it is, continuity should not be invoked when thinking about the empty set (one could come up with perfectly valid sets which make the “for all” statement discontinuous in the limit of an empty set). Instead, the proper way to think of the truth value of “for all” on the empty set, is only via the converse “exists” statement.</p>

<p>At the end of all this, I am amazed by the simplicity of evaluating truths in vacuum (vacuous truths): consider the statement p(x) = (element x does not exist). It is easy to say “for all x in the empty set, the element x does not exist”, for there exists no element x in the empty set for which the element x exists. But let’s not stop there. How about p(x) = (element x exists). Then “for all x in the empty set, the element x exists”, since there exists no element in the empty set for which the element x does not exist. <a href="http://oligotropos.wordpress.com/2014/10/02/why-all-cs-majors-should-be-required-to-take-a-course-on-real-analysis/">Same post on wordpress</a>.</p>
