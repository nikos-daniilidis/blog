I am a data scientist with a history in physics and electrical engineering ([resume here]({{ site.url }}/assets/all-pdf/daniilidis-resume.pdf)). This is my blog about science, technology, society and everything in-between. For the time being, it is a copy of my [wordpress blog](http://oligotropos.wordpress.com/). 

Until recently I have been a research physicist, working in condensed matter and atomic physics. The past few years I was studying quantum science, hybrid quantum devices as well as (very) classical noise at the UC Berkeley [ion trapping group](http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/haeffner/), and the [Innsbruck group](http://quantumoptics.at/). For my PhD work, I studied phase transitions in so called "superconducting vortex matter" (think of it as a tangle of magnetic rice noodles penetrating a superconductor and repelling each other) at [Brown](http://www.brown.edu/academics/physics/areas-research/condensed-matter-experiment/condensed-matter-experiment) and at [NIST](http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/). 

As a scientist, I was trained with the motto that ["More is Different"](http://www.pha.jhu.edu/courses/171_405/MoreIsDifferent.pdf). During the past year, I became fascinated with the new technical and intellectual possibilities that arise from analyzing information at ever expanding scales, and fully engaged in data science and machine learning. I have often teased my friends in political science and computer science that what they do is, at the end of the day, also physics -after all if you do not believe in pure ideas, everything belongs to the physical world.

I am now in the process  of exploring the limitations of my provocative claim about this "universality" of physics. In doing so, I am learning to work with massive and diverse data. Is this still physics? Probably not. The aim of this blog is discuss the methods and conclusions that I find most interesting, while trying to keep the level accessible to a relatively wide audience.
